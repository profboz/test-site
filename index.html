<div class="box1"> NEUTRAFACE</div>
<div class="box2"> <p>Neutraface is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Schwartz for House Industries, an American type foundry. It was influenced by Richard Neutra's design principles and was developed with the assistance of Neutra's son and former partner, Dion Neutra.</p>

<section id="section2"><h5>The History of Neutraface<h5>
<div class="box3"> Although better known for his residential buildings, Richard Neutra's commercial projects nevertheless resonate the same holistic ecology-unity with the surrounding landscape and uncompromising functionalism. His attention to detail even extended to the selection of signage for his buildings. It is no wonder that Neutra specified lettering that was open and unobtrusive, the same characteristics which typified his progressive architecture. House Industries brings the same linear geometry to Neutraface without sacrificing an unmistakably warm and human feel.

House Industries began the inter-disciplinary task of adapting sign lettering to typography by consulting with Dion and closely studying the archives of acclaimed photographer Julius Shulman. With limited source imagery, Christian Schwartz composed an entire alphabet and added a complementary lowercase which previously did not exist. An alternate font was also developed by following certain letter forms which often varied from building to building. The final Neutraface Display family includes five weights in regular and alternate variations and a unique titling font.

The font family's architectural origins lent to its initial creation as a headline typeface. However, in the spirit of Richard Neutra's approach, a text version of Neutraface was conceived. Departing from the unusual proportions and stylized fashion of the display version, Neutraface Text features a larger x-height and increased contrast in its strokes for enhanced readability in lengthy passages. True to the International Style, Neutraface supports over two dozen languages including Central European writing systems.
